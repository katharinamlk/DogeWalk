# DogeWalk

DogeWalk is my gratuation Project for the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).
This App lets you save little Profiles for your Dogs and logs walks you take with them. 
The walks also give you an information about your route, as well as how much you walked and how long the walk lasted.
