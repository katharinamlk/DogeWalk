# DogeWalk

DogeWalk is my gratuation Project for the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).
This App lets you save little Profiles for your Dogs and logs walks you take with them. 
The walks also give you an information about your route, as well as how much you walked and how long the walk lasted. 

### What does DogeWalk do?
With Dogewalk you can add create a profile for your dog and track your walks together. 
You can add the Profile Image of your dog by taking a cute picture or selecting an existing image from your library. The Profile also covers your dogs age, breed, sex as well as its favourite toy and treat. 
Inside the `dog tabView`, all your registered Dogs will be listed. By selecting a dog you can inspect all the walks you have done with that dog or even go a step further and edit its information.
Inside the `paw tabview`, all your walk will be listed. Select a walk to get further information. Like, which dog was present during that walk, and which route you took. 
It doesnt matter if you have one dog or 5, when you start a walk you can select all your furry companions that are participating in this particular walk.
Once the walk has started, you can see the distance you covered as well as the time you spent on this walk. 
The walk will be saved and can be viewed in your DogeWalk App!
